# Shiny Enterprise Dashboard
`ver. 1.0.0`

This is a template based on an html template and styled by Appsilon. This template contains multiple components (e.g., map, charts, KPIs). Each component is defined as a separate module which makes it easy to reuse. You can use them to build your own application. We added example data so you can run an example application after downloading the template. 

We encourage you to try to add your own elements and style them based on the examples in the application!

Tech stack:
- Shiny / htmlTemplate / rhino
- Sass, CSS Grid

## Installation
---
- Make sure that you have [renv]("https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) package installed 
- Open main directory and run `renv::restore()`
- Run the application by calling `rhino::app()`

## Rhino app folder structure
This folder follows the rhino project structure. For more information about this structure and the rhino package, check the pkgdown site https://appsilon.github.io/rhino/index.html.
---
### **root directory**
The main part of the application that contains rhino / shinyApp entrypoint `app.R`. App is initiated by calling `rhino::app()` so do not edit this file (see `app/main.R`).

### **data**
Here you can find example data used in the application.

### **app/main.R**
Here you can find the main module `main.R`. You can add your custom modules or ui and server logic to this file instead of `app.R`.

### **app/constants.R**
Contains constant variables that are being used throughout the app.

### **app/logic**
Here you can store helper R functions.

### **app/styles**
This folder contains `scss` files with UI styling. All the sass files imported to `main.scss` are compiled into a single css file in `app/static/css/app.min.css` by running `rhino::build_sass()`. Sass files are initially divided into `config` and `partials`. If you add or remove some file, you need to import or remove it from `main.scss` as well and run `rhino::build_sass()` from the R console. 

### **app/view**
This folder contains shiny modules.

### **app/js**
Here you can find `index.js`. This .js file builds into `app/static/js/app.min.js` by calling `rhino::build_js()`.

### **app/static**
This folder contains static assets such as icons or images.

### **renv**
Here you can find the `renv` package configuration folder. This package manager is necessary to install all dependencies used in this application.
